## üîÆ [Tips and Tricks](https://github.com/github/hackathons/blob/main/TipsandTricks.md)

The [Tips and Tricks file](https://github.com/github/hackathons/blob/main/TipsandTricks.md) contains lots of information on how to run your hackathon. Whether you're thinking about running an in-person, online hackathon, or hybrid hackathon, this document will help you answer some of your questions.

You can [download](https://github.com/github/hackathons/files/6497549/GitHub.Hackathon.Tips.and.Tricks.2020.pdf) this document as a PDF. Feel free to use it, share it around, and consult it.

### Contribution Guidelines

If you have new ideas you'd like to add to the Tips and Tricks document, please [head to the Discussions](https://github.com/github/hackathons/discussions/categories/tips-and-tricks) and start a conversation. If your tip or trick gets a lot of attention, we'll consider adding it to the documentation.

When talking about tips and tricks, ensure your additions/changes include information that is useful for hackathon organisers. If your addition or change does not include enough information or is not geared towards hackathon organisers, then your change will probably not be included. Remember, this repository is for hackathon organisers, not participants.

## üìö [Resources](https://github.com/github/hackathons/blob/main/Resources.md)

Organisers are often looking for good resources for running their hackathons. The [Resources file](https://github.com/github/hackathons/blob/main/Resources.md) contains a list of useful resources for you to consult. There's everything from platforms to host your hackathon, promotion sites, judging recommendations, communication tools, and more.

### Contribution Guidelines

If you would like to add a resource to the [Resources file](https://github.com/github/hackathons/blob/main/Resources.md), please [open a pull request](https://github.com/github/hackathons/pulls). Ensure your resource recommendation includes:
- Name of the resource
- Link to the resource (ie. website)
- Short description of the resource

See the [Resources document](https://github.com/github/hackathons/blob/main/Resources.md) to see how other resources are displayed. Please follow this format otherwise your pull request could be rejected. Ensure your resource is placed in the correct alphabetical order.

Format for adding your resource:

`[Name of the Resource in H2 format](with link to website)`

`Short description, between two and four sentences long. Talk about what the resource is and how it can help organisers. Ensure the link above includes https instead of http.`

`# you can add an appropriate gif, short video, or image if it suits. However, this is not necessary.`

Remember, this resource is for organisers, not participants. If your resource is not for organisers and does not meet the requirements above, your pull request may be rejected.

You can also [head to the Discussions](https://github.com/github/hackathons/discussions/categories/resources) to talk about certain resources before adding them to the documentation.
